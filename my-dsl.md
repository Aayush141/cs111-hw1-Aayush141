# Domain

_Describe the language's domain in five words._

# Computational model

_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model".
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of

The language allows you to program the speeds/duration of things like motors and other hardware equipment. It also 

# DSL-ness

_Fowler writes about a spectrum of languages, from general-purpose languages to

# Internal or external?

_Is the language implemented as an internal or external DSL?
Justify your answer._



# Host language

_What language(s) was (were) used to implement the DSL?_

C, C++

# Benefits

_Identify one potential benefit of the DSL: how is a programmer's life made
easier by the existence of this language?_

# Drawbacks

_Identify one potential drawback of the DSL: what does a programmer
lose by using this DSL instead of a general-purpose language?_
