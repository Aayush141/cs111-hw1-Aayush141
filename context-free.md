# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?

It is for graphic designers who may need to make something intricate, symetric, precise and/or uniform, that may be hard to do by hand. 

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?

It is very easy to write code that outputs something visual - shapes, lines, colors etc. It has built in commands to draw and toggle with them.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?

Since it is a DSL, it would be hard to do something more general with this language. Like, you probably do not want to work with neural networks in this language. It does have loops, if, functions and variables though - so you CAN do more than just create simple images.


## How did you learn how to program in this language?

I read the documentation available on github. 

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._

It generates an image using the commands it is given.


## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?

The art that it made would have taken a lot of time to do in photoshop or paint or something because it is a very precise yet unique shape. Using a couple loops, it did not take too long to make. The loops helped repeat the process and create a couple cool shapes.
